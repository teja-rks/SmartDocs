# 🧠 SmartDocs: Unlocking Knowledge from Multiple Documents  

**SmartDocs** is a powerful AI-driven application built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and the **Gemini API**.  
The app allows users to upload multiple documents and get intelligent answers by querying the content.  
It uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) to synthesize information from various sources, making it easier to access and understand complex data.

## 📌 Features  

✅ Upload and process **multiple documents**  
✅ **AI-powered querying** across documents using **Gemini API**  
✅ **Instant responses** based on document content  
✅ Built with **Streamlit** for interactive user experience  
✅ **LangChain** integration for document parsing and text processing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Gemini API** – For AI-powered querying and information extraction  
- **Streamlit** – Framework for creating the interactive web application  
- **LangChain** – For document processing and management  
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – For data handling and manipulation

## 🔑 API Used  

This app uses the **[Gemini API](https://www.gemini.com/)** for natural language processing and answering queries from documents.  
- **API Key**: To use the Gemini API, you need to get your own API key.  
- **Setup**: Follow these steps to integrate the Gemini API into the app:
  1. Go to [Gemini API](https://www.gemini.com/) and create an account.
  2. Get your **API key** and replace it in the app configuration file.  
  3. Use the API to query information from documents uploaded by users.
